      A federated data mesh architecture is a modern approach to data management that emphasizes decentralization, 
      domain ownership and self-service. 
      It allows organizations to scale their data infrastructure and analytics capabilities while maintaining agility, 
      flexibility and innovation. By adopting a federated data mesh architecture, companies can break down data silos, 
      empower teams to own their data products and pipelines, and foster a culture of collaboration and experimentation.

    <ul>
      <li>Federated Data Mesh Architecture organizes data by business domains instead of one central data lake</li>
      <li>Each domain owns its data products and pipelines but follows common standards for quality, security and governance</li>
      <li>This keeps data distributed and scalable while still making it easy to share, discover and reuse across the company</li>
      <li>Keep datasets, infrastructure and logs consistent and traceable.</li>
      <li>Integrate cybersecurity, data governance and fraud detection into every layer.</li>
