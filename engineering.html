      AI Monitoring and Insights is a powerful tool that uses AI to keep an eye on your systems, sensors and processes in real time. 
      It tracks key metrics and detects anomalies or drifts early, before they lead to failures or quality issues. 
      The system then turns this raw data into clear dashboards and alerts, so teams can see what is happening and why.
