      Predictive Decision Models are a key component of the AI Data Mesh architecture, 
      enabling organizations to leverage data and AI to make informed decisions. 
      These models use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical and real-time data, identify patterns, and predict future outcomes.
      By integrating predictive decision models into the decision-making process, organizations can enhance their ability to anticipate trends, optimize operations, and mitigate risks.

      <li>Predictive Decision Models learn from historical and live data to forecast what is likely to happen next</li>
      <li>They estimate future demand, risks, failures or costs and present options to decision‑makers</li>
      <li>This helps managers move from gut‑feeling decisions to data‑driven choices with clear expected outcomes.</li>
